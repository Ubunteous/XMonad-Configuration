#+title: XMonad configuration

My current window manager configuration.

A few highlights:

+ EWMH compliance (useful for bars and other widgets)
+ The main layouts are BSP, Full and a variant of Tall which efficiently uses screen space by having 3 windows opened at once top and switches to a custom grid layout if many windows are needed at once
+ Workspaces are organised in trios to emphasise task separation
+ Many popular softwares (rofi, polybar, eww, flameshot) can be called with XMonad's key bindings

You can get an overview of the code's structure by having a look at xmonad.hs

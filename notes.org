** XMonad

+ Change Sound +/- so that it disables mute if it is activated. Otherwise, increasing the sound does nothing
+ Since Alt-<arrow> and Ctrl-<arrow> have the same purpose, maybe Alt-<arrow> could instead serve to go to the next window in XMonad

=> this may be a bad idea as touch typing will change my ease to do some shortcuts. Wait and see
